    Unfortunately, we do not think you have a valid claim based on your answers to the following questions: <br>
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="displayMessage(0)"><strong>Question 1</strong> <br>
    R&D Tax Relief is for companies only, so if your business is not a company, unfortunately no R&D
    Tax Relief is available. <br>
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="displayMessage(1)"><strong>Question 2</strong> <br>
    Only Companies with a UK Permanent Establishment may be eligible for R&D Tax Relief. If your company
    is not a UK company, you may still qualify for the reliefs if you have a Permanent Establishment in the UK <br>
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="displayMessage(2)"><strong>Question 3</strong> <br>
    The time limit is the first anniversary of the filing date for the company tax return of the claimant
    company for the accounting period for which the claim is made. In practice this means a Company
    has a maximum of 2 years to make a claim after the end of an accounting period. <br>
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="displayMessage(3) && displayMessage(4)"><strong>Question 4</strong> <br>
    If you have answered no to questions 4a and 4b, it is unlikely you have been carrying on a qualifying
    R&D Activity. <br>
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="displayMessage(5)"><strong>Question 5</strong> <br>
    Risk is an essential element of R&D activity â€“ risk of failing to achieve the desired outcome,
    or success in achieving a result but in a way which is not commercially viable. <br>
  </p>
